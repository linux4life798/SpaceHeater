SpaceHeater

TURN YOUR COMPUTER INTO A SPACE HEATER!!

Somewhat kidding, but this is a tiny C program I wrote when I was a youngin' to "work" my CPU + learn C. At the time, I was probably running it on a P3 with some early version of kernel 2.6.
The name came from the apparent heat generated by the computer.

Although this program in it's current state is more or less a simple memento of my past, it does touch on an interesting subject, benchmarking...

Since git will save my original, I might have some fun expanding on this. Feel free to fork and make it into a real benchmarking program...or maybe I a spaceheater.
